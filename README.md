# Voting_Machine

Voting_Machine, is a simple digital voting machine implemented in Verilog. It demonstrates basic digital design concepts such as finite state machines, user input handling, and vote counting. The project is ideal for learning how to model real-world systems in hardware description languages and provides a foundational example for digital logic and FPGA development.

## Technical approaches
1. Finite State Machine (FSM) Design : 
A voting machine is often modeled as a finite state machine, where each state represents a stage of the voting process (e.g., idle, voting, result display). The transitions between states are triggered by user inputs (like pressing buttons).

2. Synchronous Sequential Logic : 
All operations (registering votes, resetting, displaying results) are synchronized with a system clock, ensuring predictable and reliable operation.

3. Debouncing User Inputs : 
Mechanical switches and buttons used for voting can cause multiple unwanted transitions (bounces). The design may include debouncing circuits or logic to ensure each press is registered only once.

4. Vote Counting with Registers : 
Each candidate's vote count is stored in a register. When a vote is cast, the corresponding register is incremented.

5. Reset and Initialization Logic : 
The machine can be reset to its initial state, clearing all vote counts and returning to the idle state. This is typically controlled by a reset input.

6. Testbench and Simulation : 
Verilog testbenches are written to simulate the voting process, check correctness, and verify that the FSM behaves as expected under various scenarios.
