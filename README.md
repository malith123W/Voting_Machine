# Voting_Machine

Voting_Machine, is a simple digital voting machine implemented in Verilog. It demonstrates basic digital design concepts such as finite state machines, user input handling, and vote counting. The project is ideal for learning how to model real-world systems in hardware description languages and provides a foundational example for digital logic and FPGA development.
